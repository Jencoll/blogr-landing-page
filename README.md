## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- It took me lots of time and efforts to complete the navbar; especially the submenu. But I found a useful way to create this submenu so that it is fluid.
    -> The problem I encounter with this solution, is that it doesn't seem to work on Firefox even if the fit-content property is supposed to me supported by this browser. In Chrome, it works fine.

- Another problem I got and I still didn't find the solution is the underline on the menu items. When I target the children of the menu to underline them, it underlines even the grand-children. Even if I use the specific class in the target. So this is something to be solved. 

### Continued development

- JavaScript is where I have to focus most. I am pretty happy with what I've made for this project, but I need to think more with problem resolution in mind.
- I want to practice more and more advanced CSS techniques so that I can master them more easily.

### Useful resources

- MDN
- StackOverflow
